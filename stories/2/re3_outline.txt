1. Asher Hall explores the first three levels of the underground lab, finding tapes recording the events leading up to its closure. They posthumously introduce Dr. Freeman, Dr. Summerside, and Simon Price, who's so far resisted brainwashing.
2. On level 4, Asher finds tapes showing Dr. Summerside injecting Simon with agents designed to cause personality changes, and Dr. Freeman showing him videos of her latest work to desensitize him.
3. On level 5, Asher finds tapes of Dr. Summerside and Dr. Freeman arguing about which of their approaches will ultimately create a better society. As Simon's compassion gradually fails, he begins to chime in.
4. On level 6, Asher finds a tap of Dr. Summerside and Dr. Freeman fighting over a funding cut. Simon uses the distraction to sabotages Dr. Summerside's lab. Her latest disease leaks out and drives Dr. Freeman insane enough to release her own lethal virus, killing everyone.
5. On the seventh and lowest level, Asher finds viable samples of Dr. Summerside's empathy-reducing virus. He contemplates taking it to numb the horrors of what he's just witnessed.
