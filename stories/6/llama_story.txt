Story: 
Shannon Daniels sat in her attic, surrounded by canvases, paints, and brushes, the smell of turpentine and linseed oil filling the air. It was her sanctuary, her escape from the pain and grief that had consumed her since her mother's passing. Sara Daniels, her loving mother, had lost her battle with cancer just a few months ago, leaving Shannon feeling lost and alone. 
The attic, once a dusty storage space, had been transformed into Shannon's personal art studio, a place where she could express her emotions and connect with her mother's memory. Her uncle, Jeff, had helped her set it up, encouraging her to pursue her passion for art. Shannon's art teacher, Rosemary Jacobs, had also been a constant source of support, recognizing her talent and nurturing it. 
As Shannon dipped her brush into a vibrant shade of blue, she felt her mother's presence around her. She began to paint, the strokes bold and expressive, the colors blending together in a beautiful dance. Painting had become her solace, her way of communicating with her mother, who she felt was still with her in spirit. 
Days turned into weeks, and Shannon's paintings began to take on a life of their own. She would talk to them, imagine them talking back, and feel comforted by their silent companionship. There was "Sunset," a warm and fiery piece that reminded her of her mother's bright smile; "Lily," a delicate and intricate painting that symbolized her mother's gentle touch; and "Stormy Weather," a turbulent and emotional piece that reflected her own feelings of sadness and anger. 
Shannon's paintings had become her new family, each one a reflection of her mother's love and influence. They stood like sentinels around her, watching over her, and protecting her from the darkness that had threatened to consume her. As she worked on a new piece, "Moonlight," a soft and dreamy painting that captured the essence of her mother's gentle guidance, Shannon felt a sense of peace settle over her. 
Her paintings were not just a form of expression; they were a way of keeping her mother's memory alive. They were a reminder that even in death, her mother's love continued to inspire and guide her. As Shannon stepped back to admire her work, she felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. She was no longer alone; she had her paintings, her new family, to support and comfort her. 
Katie Matthews, her classmate and friend, had been a constant source of support, often visiting Shannon in her attic studio and marveling at her talent. Missy Walters, her best friend and fellow art enthusiast, had also been a rock, sharing her own experiences with loss and grief. Together, they had formed a bond, a connection that went beyond words and spoke directly to the heart. 
As Shannon looked around her studio, she knew that she had found a new sense of purpose. Her paintings would continue to be her solace, her comfort, and her connection to her mother's love. They would remind her that even in the darkest of times, there was always beauty to be found, always a way to express the emotions that threatened to overwhelm her. Shannon's paintings had given her a new lease on life, a reason to keep moving forward, and a way to keep her mother's memory alive.
