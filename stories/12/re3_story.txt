The next morning Anna Cooper wakes up early to start her new job as a school janitor. She has been hired for the position because she is fast and efficient with her cleaning duties, and she is always willing to go above and beyond what is expected of her. She arrives at the school before the other students arrive, so she has time to clean the classrooms before they arrive.

   Anna is excited about her new job and plans to do it well so that she can be considered for more jobs in the future. As she cleans a classroom, her niece Maryanne arrives at the school. Maryanne is an excellent student who has always done well in school, and everyone expects great things from her in the future.

   When Maryanne sees her aunt sweeping up, she asks if she can help out and get some experience by helping her during her work day. Anna is glad to have help at this point because Maryanne is not an experienced cleaner. The two of them sweep up the classroom until it is time for the other students to arrive. Once they have cleaned all the rooms, they leave for a late lunch.

   When they come back to the school after lunch, they see that everything looks good and ready for the students. Annathen reminds Maryanne that she has to go home before curfew. She tells Maryanne that she cannot watch her work, but Maryanne says that she would be willing to stay.

   As the day progresses, Anna works hard and cleans all the classrooms efficiently. One of the teachers, Miss Miller, notices and compliments her work ethic. When Anna says that she likes her job because it is easy work and she wants to get more cleaning jobs in the future, Miss Miller asks if she would like a job as a teacher when she graduates from high school. Anna declines, saying that teaching is not for her. Miss Miller acknowledges this and suggests that Anna might want to consider being a counselor instead, since she seems to be good with children.

   The next day at work is similar to the first - fast-paced cleaning, quick lunch and back to work before the students arrive. The only major difference is that Anna notices that some of the students are getting a bit too friendly with their teachers. She does not say anything because she does not want to gossip or cause trouble, but she is bothered by what she sees, so she goes home early and does not tell her husband about it.

   On Saturday morning, Anna wakes up early to go backto her cleaning job. She has a new list of things to do, including cleaning the hallways. As she cleans, several of the students walk out of their classes and pass by her, making fun of her appearance and laughing at her clothes. She is used to this kind of treatment from some of the students and does not react too much to it, but a few minutes later when Anna hears Maryanne say that she is going to visit a friend, she feels scared and alone. She wonders how long Maryanne has been talking about this friend and if anyone will notice or care if something happens to Anna while she is alone. Anna decides that it would be best for Maryanne to stay with her, so she asks Maryanne if she wants to help her clean the hallways and put the chairs away in the auditorium. Maryanne happily agrees and they spend the rest of the day together.

   When Anna shows up for work on Monday morning, Miss Miller informs her that she is no longer needed at the school. She offers Anna a letter of recommendation if the young woman needs one; however, this means that Maryanne will have nothing to do during her lunch hour, so Miss Miller suggests that Maryanne stay with her. Once again, Anna reluctantly agreesto let Maryanne stay with her during her lunch hour. All morning, the two women work in silence. They do not speak to each other and they avoid eye contact. At the end of the day, Anna is given a letter of recommendation by Miss Miller and she tells the principal that she will not be returning to work at the school.

   After being fired from her job, Anna decides that she needs to figure out why Maryanne is so interested in seeing her aunt every day. So, the next day during lunchtime, she goes over to Maryanne where she finds Maryanne smiling and laughing in a car with another student named Tommy Washington. The two students tell Anna that they are going to meet at Maryanne’s aunt’s house and then they drive off. Anna thinks back to the previous day when she had noticed a man talking with Maryanne’s aunt. She wonders if her suspicions are true—that Maryanne is being molested by her teacher—but she does not know what to do or how to go about telling the police about it.

   That night, while Anna is cleaning the restroom at the school, Daniel Cooper comes into the room and tells her that he has an important meeting in the morning thatrequires him to do some research for work. Anna asks if she should come with him, but he says no and leaves the room. When Daniel returns home that night, he finds Anna waiting for him. He can tell from her expression that something is wrong and she tells him about Maryanne’s strange behavior. Daniel is shocked by what Anna has told him, but he does not want to get involved with the matter because Maryanne is Lily’s little sister and he feels like it would be inappropriate to get involved in this situation. So, they go to bed without deciding what they should do about Maryanne’s situation, but Anna still feels a great sense of guilt and anxiety about what she should do.

   The next day at school, people have been gossiping about what happened with Anna and Miss Miller. Some people think that Anna deserves to be fired for trying to cause trouble. Others think that it may not be a good idea to fire Anna because she might end up telling some of the teachers about the secrets they have been keeping at the school. As a result of her work as a janitor, Anna knows some terrible things about the people that work in the school. She is aware of how many of them are doing drugs andhaving sex with students. She also knows about the kind of disgusting things that go on between certain teachers and their students. All of these things make Anna feel like she should not be working in a place that causes so much harm to children.

   Later, Anna meets up with Tommy and Maryanne again. She suggests that they all go to dinner together, but Daniel cannot join them since he has a prior commitment with his wife Anna. So, they head out without him and go to Miss Miller’s house instead.

   When Maryanne enters the kitchen, she sees Miss Miller sitting at the table smoking a cigarette with her arms crossed. Maryanne is uncomfortable being there with her teacher because she knows that this woman wants to have sex with her. When Maryanne’s aunt enters the room, she tells Maryanne that her daughter Lily could use a private tutor in math. Miss Miller then responds by telling Maryanne’s aunt that her niece could be a great tutor for Lily, but she would need to come to the school every day. Maryanne’s aunt agrees and says that she will call Miss Miller later in regards to when she can start the tutoring sessions.

   That night at home, Daniel asks Annaif she spoke to Maryanne, and Anna lies and says that she did not. She then asks him why he cannot just go to dinner with her like she asked him to do originally. Daniel responds by saying that he has a lot of work on his plate, and he does not have time for a date right now. Anna is irritated by his response because she feels like he does not understand what it is like to be the only one who works in the household while also trying to raise children alone. She then begins to ask him questions about his career and reminds him that if it was not for her, he would not be able to make a living. Finally, she brings up the fact that he never invited Maryanne’s aunt over for dinner. Daniel begins to respond by saying that Maryanne’s aunt is just a friend, but Anna stops him and reminds him of what Lily told her about how she was the only girl who had ever visited her teacher’s house. She then tells him that she does not like it when he lies to her because it makes her feel like she does not know him.

- After both of them cool down, they promise to make an effort to spend more time together by doing things like eating dinner andwatching movies at home more often. Meanwhile, Lily decides to confront Miss Miller once again about the rumors going around about her on the playground. She then asks her if it is true that she is a lesbian, but Miss Miller denies this accusation and calls Lily names like “trash” and “troublemaker.” This upsets Lily, but she stays quiet because she knows that Miss Miller would send her home early if she continues to ask questions. Finally, Miss Miller asks Lily why she even cares about rumors since she is a “good girl who just wants to graduate so that she can get out of this town.” She then tells Lily that all of the girls at School Street used to be wild when they were in grade school until they got married and had children. She then begins to boast about how well Maryanne is doing in school and hints that she might even be able to attend college someday soon.

- Meanwhile, Maryanne continues to think about Anna’s questions during the car ride home from the restaurant. As she continues to think about these questions, she realizes that Anna is right about how everyone in town assumed that they were lesbians despite the fact that they never even hugged each other. She then tells herselfthat if they had been lovers that the town ladies would have known about it by now and would have set their husbands on them.

When she returns home, Maryanne tries to tell her parents that she no longer wants to go by Anna at school anymore. She tells them that she is sick of people calling her a lesbian just because she is friends with Anna Cooper. Unfortunately, her parents will not hear what she is saying. They just continue to tell her that they will not ruin the reputation of their family by having a “lesbian daughter.” Maryanne sees that there is nothing that she can do, so she decides to go back upstairs and be ashamed of who she truly is.

- Meanwhile, Lily and Tommy run into each other at the lunchroom, where he tries to talk about rumors that he has heard about Lily being a lesbian. She doesn’t want to talk to him because she knows what he is going to say, so she tries to avoid the issue by asking him who told him such a thing. He answers her by telling her that everyone was talking about it on the playground during lunchtime. Tom then warns Lily not to get on Anna’s bad side because she is “capable of anything.” He also tells her that Anna will try to ruin Lily’s reputation at school in the same way that she did to Tommy.

- When Maryanne gets back to her room, she sees that Tom and his friends are waiting outside for her again. She figures out that they are the ones spreading the rumors about her sexual orientation, so she goes outside to confront them. The boys threaten Maryanne with violence if she does not go away. She realizes that they are more than just bullies and that they represent an even bigger problem at the school.

- Anna has just finished cleaning the hallways when she hears Tommy threatening Maryanne outside of her room. She runs outside and finds Maryanne on the ground with a broken arm and bloody face. The student she attacked comes out from behind a tree with his head bandaged and warns Anna to stay away from Maryanne or he will tell their parents about what happened. In response, Anna tells Tommy and his friends that next time, they will have to deal with her fist.

- Lily goes into Miss Miller’s room before school ends to thank her for all of her help; however, she is surprised when Miss Miller begins to speak about the rumors about her being a lesbian. Theteacher asks Lily if she has ever had sexual feelings towards another woman, but Lily refuses to answer any of her questions.

- After school, Laura tells Maryanne that she and the other girls now call Anna “the witch” because of her attitude. The two girls agree that they should do something about this problem themselves since no one else will help them. Maryanne suggests that they ask Anna if she can talk to their parents about it; however, Laura refuses to do so because she knows that it will only make things worse for them.

- That night, Anna asks Daniel if he has heard any more stories about Lily’s classmates threatening Maryanne. He confirms this and adds that they have not been acting like normal children either. Daniel is sure that whatever is going on in the town will affect their children as well, so he is very concerned about keeping them safe.

- After Anna has gone to bed, Daniel sits up in bed and thinks about what has been happening at the school. He remembers how his third-grade teacher walked into her classroom with a black eye and broken arm one day after being attacked by a group of boys. He also remembers how she refused to talk about what happened and left right after school was dismissed. This event had a profound effect on him as a child and is still affecting him now, so he decides that he must do something about the situation at the school so that it will not affect his family.

- The next morning, Anna arrives at the school earlier than usual. She goes into the building and heads straight to the principal’s office. As she approaches his door, she sees that it is closed, but she decides to knock anyway just in case he is awake. She knocks once on the door, but there is no answer. She knocks again, but there is still no answer; she begins to wonder whether or not she woke him up. She decides to put her ear up against the door in hopes of hearing some noise coming from inside; however, there is only silence. Anna turns around and leaves the office because she is not trying to disturb him at this early hour. She goes back outside and heads for the school’s main office. As she walks down the hall, she stops by a classroom door that is open; it belongs to Miss Miller’s class. Anna looks inside and sees that all the lights are off, so she decides to go in and check on her.She takes a quick peek inside the room and notices that everything is quiet and still, so she walks in to investigate. She looks around the room for a moment but does not find anyone there; the room is completely vacant, like no one has been there at all. Anna is confused by this and wonders where everyone could have gone. She decides to stand in the doorway for a moment to see if anyone will come out of class soon. Just as she is thinking this, she hears noises coming from behind her. She turns around and finds that Lily Washington has emerged from the classroom door and is walking toward her. Lily waves at Anna and smiles; Anna returns the gesture but keeps her eyes peeled because she does not trust her. Lily asks Anna what she is doing standing there, but Anna ignores Lily’s question and tells her to return to class. Anna reaches out and grabs Lily’s arm, but instead of pulling on it, she pushes it away from her body. She tells Lily to go home because there is no school today. Lily frowns and begins to argue with Anna about this, so Anna drags her toward the doorway and pushes her out into the hallway. As they are walking down the hall together, Lily asks Anna why she thinks that thereis no school today. Anna explains to her that it is Friday and everyone should be at home doing their work. Anna looks over at the clock in the hallway while she is talking; it says 8:59 a.m., and Miss Miller’s class starts at 8:50 a.m., so class must be over by now. They walk outside and Lily begins to run away from Anna, but Anna runs after her until she stops her from attempting to leave the building. She reminds Lily that it is not safe for her to be outside right now because of all the bad things that have been happening at the school and tells her that she should forget about school and just start to work on her homework.

Lily says nothing in response; instead she whines like a little girl who wants something but does not have the money to buy it. Anna explains that working on homework means doing well in school; however, Lily tells her that people who do well in school are not nice people. Anna’s eyes widen at these words and her mouth opens slightly before closing. She tries to explain to Lily that most of the students at the school are very nice; in fact, she thinks that Lily is a very nice girl herself. But before Anna canget any more words out, Lily runs off and runs around the building trying to catch up with her friends from school. Anna has no choice but to watch her flee from the doors of the building and jump into a waiting car that is ready to drive away.

Anna waits for about ten minutes then walks back inside. She hears a crash come from behind the door just as she is about to enter, so she hurries away from it. It must be from one of the boys, she thinks to herself because Maryanne would not have done such a thing. When she gets back inside, she walks down the hallway and looks for Daniel Cooper, but he says nothing when he sees her so Anna walks back down the hall and heads toward Miss Miller’s classroom. She finds all of the chairs pushed in and the room empty, so she follows her instinct and takes a look inside Maryanne’s second grade classroom. It is empty as well so Anna moves on to Miss Miller’s first grade classroom. She finds that it is also empty, but she notices a pile of books on the floor beneath Miss Miller’s desk. She bends down to pick up one of the books in an attempt to read it, but when she does, she feels a sharp pain in her back and everything goes black.
