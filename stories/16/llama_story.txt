Story:
The sun had long since set on the small town of Shepherdstown, Virginia, casting a dark and foreboding shadow over its quaint streets and homes. It was a typical autumn evening, with the crisp air carrying the scent of fallen leaves and woodsmoke. But for Jenna Riley, this night would be anything but typical.
As she walked home from the local diner, where she worked as a waitress, Jenna couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. She quickened her pace, her long brown hair bouncing with each step. Suddenly, a hand clamped over her mouth, and she was dragged into the alley between the diner and the old movie theater. The last thing she remembered was the sound of her own screams, muffled by the hand, and the feeling of her body hitting the ground.
A week later, Jenna woke up in the hospital, her blue eyes fluttering open to an unfamiliar ceiling. She tried to sit up, but a sharp pain shot through her head, forcing her back onto the pillow. A gentle voice spoke to her, telling her to stay calm, that she was safe. But Jenna's mind was racing. What had happened to her? Why couldn't she remember anything?
As she looked around the hospital room, Jenna noticed a figure standing in the corner, watching her. He was a large man, with balding hair and piercing green eyes. Damian Henchman, the doctor introduced himself, explaining that he had been the one to find her in the alley and bring her to the hospital.
But as Jenna began to piece together her memories, she realized that something was terribly wrong. She was hungry, but not for food. She was thirsty, but not for water. And her senses seemed heightened, as if she could hear and see everything around her with an unnatural clarity.
Damian's eyes seemed to hold a secret, and Jenna sensed that he knew more about her condition than he was letting on. It wasn't until she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror, however, that she realized the true extent of her transformation. Her eyes, once a bright blue, now seemed to glow with an otherworldly light. And her skin, once smooth and unblemished, was now deathly pale.
Jenna was a vampire.
As she struggled to come to terms with her new existence, Jenna became obsessed with finding her attacker and bringing them to justice. But she was not alone in her quest. Liam Cross, a handsome and mysterious stranger, seemed to be watching her from the shadows. And Elijah Sedgewick, an older man with a kind face and a wealth of knowledge, offered to guide her through the treacherous world of the undead.
But not everyone was friendly. Randolph Howe, a gruff and imposing man, seemed to take great pleasure in Jenna's discomfort. And Gregory Maldonado, a middle-aged man with a sinister grin, whispered warnings in her ear, telling her to beware of those who would seek to harm her.
As Jenna navigated this new world, she found herself drawn to Charlotte Vale, a beautiful woman with a quick wit and a sharp tongue. And Antonia Rossi, a stunning woman with dark hair and piercing eyes, seemed to understand her in a way that no one else did.
But it was Katherine Bray, a lovely woman with shoulder-length brown hair and a gentle smile, who would become Jenna's closest ally. Together, they would uncover the truth about Jenna's attacker, and bring them to justice.
As the days turned into weeks, Jenna found herself growing stronger, her powers increasing with each passing night. She was a vampire, and she would not be silenced. She would not be defeated. And she would not rest until she had found the one who had changed her life forever.
