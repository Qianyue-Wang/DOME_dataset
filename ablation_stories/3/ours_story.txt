Daisy Mayberry's vibrant spirit, which usually illuminated even the dreariest of days, was now fading. The morning air, once invigorating, struggled to spark a semblance of energy within her as she trudged through the park, her steps slow and deliberate. Her once bright blue eyes were now shadowed by a veil of fatigue, and the bloom on her cheeks had given way to a concerning paleness.
