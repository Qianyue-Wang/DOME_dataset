Her head throbbed, and she could hear the rhythmic beeping of machines nearby. As she tried to sit up, she was startled by the newfound sharpness of her senses. Every sound, every smell, every touch seemed heightened, as if she was experiencing the world through a filter she had never known existed.
The scent of blood, so faint to anyone else, was overpowering to her. Her throat burned with an insatiable thirst, making her lips part in anticipation.
